PolygenicAdaptationCode
=======================
This repository contains R code implementing the methods described in my paper with Graham Coop, titled "A Population Genetic Signal of Polygenic Adaptation": arXiv:1307.7759v2

The final version of this paper will be appearing in PLOS Genetics shortly, and I will have more extensive documentation included here by the time it is published. If you want to use this code in the mean time, feel free to contact me (jeremy.jackson.berg@gmail.com) so I can walk you through file formats and such.
